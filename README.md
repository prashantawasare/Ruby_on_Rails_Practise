## 🔍 What’s Inside?

### 🧠 Theoretical Concepts

The `01_theory/` folder contains detailed explanations of essential Ruby programming topics:

- ✅ Introduction to Ruby and its features  
- ✅ Ruby syntax and code structure  
- ✅ Variables and data types  
- ✅ Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)  
- ✅ Conditional statements (`if`, `unless`, `case`)  
- ✅ Looping constructs (`while`, `until`, `for`, `.each`)  
- ✅ Methods and arguments  
- ✅ Arrays and Hashes  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- ✅ Classes, Objects, and Inheritance  
- ✅ Modules and Mixins  
- ✅ File handling (read/write)  
- ✅ Exception handling (`begin`, `rescue`, `ensure`)  
- ✅ Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas  
- ✅ Common built-in Ruby methods  

Each topic includes examples, syntax, and use-cases to improve understanding.

### 💻 Practical Ruby Programs

The `02_programs/` folder includes categorized practice programs:

- 🔢 **Basic Programs**  
  E.g., Fibonacci series, factorial, prime check, etc.

- 📂 **File Handling Programs**  
  Read from and write to files using Ruby.

- 🧮 **String Manipulation**  
  Reverse string, count vowels, check palindrome, etc.

- 📊 **Data Structure Examples**  
  Create and manipulate arrays, hashes.

- 🧰 **Object-Oriented Examples**  
  Class creation, method overloading, inheritance.

- 💬 **User Input/Output Programs**  
  Simple CLI-based apps.

Each file is well-commented and designed for self-practice and learning.
